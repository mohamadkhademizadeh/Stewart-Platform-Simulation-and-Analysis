Conducted an in-depth analysis and simulation study to assess the response of a Stewart Platform to applied forces, contributing to design optimization and structural stability evaluations. The Stewart Platform, a parallel manipulator comprising six linear actuators connected to a movable platform, was the focus of investigation due to its significance in various engineering applications. Utilized advanced simulation software, including Simscape Multibody, to develop a detailed model of the Stewart Platform. The simulation model integrated geometric properties, inertial characteristics, and mechanical constraints, facilitating accurate representation of the platform's behavior. Applied a known force at the platform's center to simulate real-world scenarios.
